Completing the course will reward a certificate - completing the Digital Skills track will reward you with another. 

The Digital Skills sessions are meant to enable people to use tools like the Office Suite, as well as things like basic video and audio
editing to their advantage - for their own personal use or for standing out professionally. 

To download the files, go to the main repository page - available at: https://github.com/Makataui/Digital-Skills-Excel and use the green
"Clone or Download" button to download the ZIP version of this series - you will get all of the lessons, folders available. 

Or, if you know what you're doing with GitHub - you can clone the repo and grab the files as you need them!

If you have any issues, please head over the Issues tab (available next to the <> Code tab) and see if anyone else has asked about your issue, if not, just create a new one and let us know about it. 

Any questions/issues related to lesson content - not related to the files - should be sent to psychtech@lincoln.ac.uk - please don't put them in issues for the repository.

Good luck and have fun!
